# Clustering Algorithms (K-means vs. Mean Shift) 

The project consists of studying two clustering algorithms: the K-means algorithm and the mean shift clustering algorithm.

In the fields of machine learning and data science, data clustering plays a crucial role in exploratory analysis and unsupervised classification. Clustering algorithms are useful for several reasons. One application of clustering algorithms is identifying patterns in unlabeled data to discover relationships between data points. Another application is image segmentation based on pixels, where clustering is performed using different pixels to recognize shapes in an image, for example.

Among the various available clustering techniques, the K-means and Mean Shift algorithms stand out for their popularity and effectiveness in various application contexts. K-means clustering, with its simplicity and fast execution, is widely used to divide a dataset into a predefined number of clusters, thereby optimizing the sum of intra-cluster squared distances. On the other hand, Mean Shift clustering, based on density estimation, automatically detects the number of clusters by focusing on density maxima in the feature space. This report aims to explore in detail the operation, advantages, and disadvantages of these two algorithms, highlighting their fundamental differences and respective application domains.
